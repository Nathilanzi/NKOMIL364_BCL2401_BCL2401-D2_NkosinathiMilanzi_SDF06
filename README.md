## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I am extremly confident in flexbox due to the zombie game. it really led me through all the steps neccessary to quickly master the code while having fun.
- **Responsive Design**: a web design approach to make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability. ensured all types would be supported.  
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to work on the styling and elements like profile picture, gallery, user info, to look like instagram.

#### Challenges Faced

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: struggled a bit with grids and making sure my images properly lined up and maintained it order.
- **Time**: this project required a lot of work and maybe my lack of time management had me super focused on the smaller details and not leaving time for everything else 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: ensuring the compatibilty works well across all screens and all the font sizes cooperate.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: they needed quite a lot of practice in order to make sure the code always works


#### Overall Learning Experience
The project was like being thrown into the deep end and told to swim. it was scary in the beginning but once you get to paddling you enjoy the process.
